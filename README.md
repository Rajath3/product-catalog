Covered in this repository:

Functional:

1. Table display using MUI and React.
2. The table data is populated via JSON file.
3. The Add button at the top of table can be used to add record to the table.
4. The table rows can be edited and deleted.
5. The name column has link for individual products and clicking on them would visit the product detail page.

Technical aspects:

1. Used MUI and React for table display and individual product display.
2. The initial data is loaded from JSON file and stored in local storage.
3. Purpose of using local storage is to retain the data. Although we want persist the data, we can use nodejs app as backend as use API services from there.

Improvements:

1. Can use database/file in backend to persist data.
2. Refactoring some components.
